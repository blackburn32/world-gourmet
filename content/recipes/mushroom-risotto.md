**Ingredients**
- 1 cup of Arborio rice
- 4 cups of vegetable or chicken broth
- 1 cup of mushrooms (such as cremini or button), thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup of white wine
- 1/2 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons of butter
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley or thyme for garnish (optional)

**Instructions**
1. In a saucepan, heat the vegetable or chicken broth over low heat and keep it simmering throughout the cooking process.
2. In a separate large, deep skillet or pot, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat.
3. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet and sauté until the onion becomes translucent and fragrant.
4. Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they start to brown and release their moisture.
5. Add the Arborio rice to the skillet and stir well to coat each grain with the butter and oil mixture.
6. Pour in the white wine and stir until it is absorbed by the rice.
7. Begin adding the simmering broth to the skillet, one ladle at a time, stirring continuously until each ladleful is absorbed before adding the next one. This process will gradually cook the rice and help it release its starches, resulting in a creamy texture.
8. Continue adding ladles of broth and stirring until the rice is tender with a slight firmness, known as "al dente." This process usually takes around 20-25 minutes.
9. Once the rice is cooked to your desired consistency, remove the skillet from heat. Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese and season with salt and pepper to taste.
10. Allow the risotto to rest for a few minutes to let the flavors meld together.
11. Serve the mushroom risotto hot, garnished with fresh parsley or thyme, if desired.
