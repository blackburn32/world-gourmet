**Ingredients**
- 1 pound (450g) ziti pasta
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound (450g) ground beef or Italian sausage
- 1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes
- 1 can (14 ounces) diced tomatoes
- 2 teaspoons dried Italian seasoning
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 cup ricotta cheese
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)

**Instructions**
1. Preheat your oven to 375F (190C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray or butter.
2. Cook the ziti pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
3. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and saute until softened and fragrant.
4. Add the ground beef or Italian sausage to the skillet, breaking it up with a spoon. Cook until browned and cooked through.
5. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes, along with the Italian seasoning. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
6. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked ziti pasta, half of the tomato sauce, and half of the shredded mozzarella cheese. Mix well to coat the pasta evenly.
7. Transfer half of the pasta mixture to the greased baking dish. Top with spoonfuls of ricotta cheese, spreading it out in an even layer. Sprinkle with half of the Parmesan cheese.
8. Repeat with the remaining pasta mixture, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, and Parmesan cheese, creating a second layer.
9. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until golden and bubbly.
10. Remove from the oven and let the baked ziti cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired, before serving.

Enjoy your comforting and cheesy Baked Ziti!
