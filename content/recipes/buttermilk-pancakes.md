**Ingredients**
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
- Cooking spray or additional butter for greasing the pan

**Instructions**
1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, and melted butter until well combined.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.
4. Preheat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease the skillet with cooking spray or butter.
5. Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, pour the pancake batter onto the skillet. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip the pancake and cook until golden brown on both sides.
6. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more cooking spray or butter as needed.
7. Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh berries, or whipped cream.

Enjoy your fluffy and delicious buttermilk pancakes!
