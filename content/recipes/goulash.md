7. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the goulash simmer for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
8. After 1 hour, add the diced bell pepper and potatoes. Stir well and continue to simmer for another 30 minutes or until the beef is tender and the potatoes are cooked through.
9. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
10. Remove the bay leaf and discard.
11. Serve the goulash hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley.
12. Enjoy your hearty and flavorful goulash with crusty bread or over cooked noodles.
