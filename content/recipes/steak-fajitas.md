**Ingredients**
- 1 lb flank steak, thinly sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- Juice of 1 lime
- 2 tablespoons of soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon of cumin
- 1 teaspoon of chili powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Warm tortillas, for serving

**Instructions**
1. In a bowl, combine the lime juice, soy sauce, minced garlic, cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
2. Add the thinly sliced flank steak to the marinade, making sure it's well coated. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 4 hours in the refrigerator.
3. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated steak and cook for 3-4 minutes per side, or until cooked to your desired doneness. Remove the steak from the skillet and set aside.
4. In the same skillet, add the sliced bell peppers and onions. Sauté for 5-6 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly charred.
5. Return the cooked steak to the skillet with the bell peppers and onions. Stir to combine everything and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
6. Serve the steak fajitas with warm tortillas. You can also garnish with toppings like guacamole, sour cream, and salsa if desired.
