**Ingredients**

- 1 tablespoon of olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon of dried thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Chopped fresh parsley for garnish

**Instructions**
1. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.
2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, until golden brown. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
3. In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté until the onion becomes translucent and the garlic is fragrant.
4. Add the rice and dried thyme to the skillet. Stir well to coat the rice with the onion and garlic mixture.
5. Pour in the chicken broth and bring it to a boil.
6. Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.
7. While the rice is cooking, slice the cooked chicken breasts into thin strips.
8. Once the rice is cooked, return the sliced chicken to the skillet and stir gently to combine.
9. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.
10. Serve the chicken and rice hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley.
