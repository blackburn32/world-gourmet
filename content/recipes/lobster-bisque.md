**Ingredients**
- 2 lobsters (about 1 1/2 pounds each)
- 2 tablespoons of butter
- 1 onion, diced
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 carrots, diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 2 tablespoons of tomato paste
- 1/4 cup of brandy
- 4 cups of seafood stock
- 1 cup of heavy cream
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh chives, chopped (for garnish)

**Instructions**
1. Start by boiling a pot of water. Add the lobsters and cook for about 8-10 minutes, until they turn bright red.
2. Remove the lobsters from the water and let them cool. Once cooled, remove the meat from the shells and set it aside.
3. In a large soup pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery. Cook until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.
4. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for another minute.
5. Add the brandy and cook until most of the alcohol evaporates.
6. Pour in the seafood stock and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 20 minutes.
7. Use an immersion blender or transfer the mixture to a blender to puree until smooth.
8. Return the mixture to the pot and stir in the heavy cream.
9. Chop the reserved lobster meat into bite-sized pieces and add it to the pot. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes, until the lobster is heated through.
10. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
11. Serve hot, garnished with fresh chives.

Enjoy your delicious Lobster Bisque!
