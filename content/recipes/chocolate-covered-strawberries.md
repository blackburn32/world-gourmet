**Ingredients:**
- 1 pound of fresh strawberries
- 8 ounces of semi-sweet or dark chocolate, chopped
- Optional toppings: crushed nuts, shredded coconut, sprinkles

**Instructions:**
1. Rinse the strawberries under cold water and pat them dry gently with a paper towel.
2. Line a baking sheet or tray with parchment paper.
3. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the chocolate in intervals of 30 seconds, stirring in between, until it is fully melted and smooth. Alternatively, you can also melt the chocolate using a double boiler method.
4. Hold each strawberry by the stem and dip it into the melted chocolate, swirling it to coat the entire strawberry. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off.
5. Place the chocolate-covered strawberry onto the prepared baking sheet or tray. Repeat the process for all the strawberries.
6. If desired, while the chocolate is still wet, sprinkle the optional toppings over the strawberries.
7. Once all the strawberries are coated, place the baking sheet or tray in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to allow the chocolate to set.
8. Once the chocolate has hardened, remove the strawberries from the refrigerator and serve immediately.

These chocolate-covered strawberries make for a delightful dessert or a special treat for romantic occasions. Enjoy!
