**Ingredients**
- 1 lb (450g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 cup plain yogurt
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons ground coriander
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated
- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 1 cup heavy cream
- Cilantro leaves, for garnish

**Instructions**
1. In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, garam masala, and salt. Add the chicken pieces, ensuring they are fully coated. Allow the chicken to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour (or overnight for maximum flavor).
2. Preheat the grill or broiler to medium-high heat. Thread the marinated chicken onto skewers and grill for 10-12 minutes, or until cooked through and slightly charred.
3. In a large pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent.
4. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the pan and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.
5. Stir in the crushed tomatoes and simmer for 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
6. Reduce the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Simmer for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. Add the grilled chicken pieces to the sauce and continue cooking for an additional 5-10 minutes, until the chicken is heated through and the sauce has thickened slightly.
8. Serve the Chicken Tikka Masala over steamed rice or with naan bread. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves before serving.
