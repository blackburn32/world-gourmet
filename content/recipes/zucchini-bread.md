**Ingredients:**
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups grated zucchini (about 2 medium zucchinis)
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan and set aside.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg until well combined. Set aside.
3. In a separate bowl, beat together the melted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until well combined and slightly creamy.
4. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.
5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
6. Fold in the grated zucchini and chopped nuts (if using).
7. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula.
8. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean.
9. Remove the bread from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.

Enjoy a slice of freshly baked zucchini bread with a spread of butter or cream cheese. It's delicious served warm or at room temperature.
