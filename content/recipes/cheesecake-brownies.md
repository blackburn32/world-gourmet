**Ingredients:**

For the brownie batter:
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 4 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, chopped
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

For the cheesecake batter:
- 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line an 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper.
2. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the butter and chopped chocolate. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the mixture is smooth and melted.
3. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract. Gradually pour in the melted chocolate mixture, stirring until well combined.
4. Add the flour and salt to the chocolate mixture, and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.
5. In another bowl, beat together the softened cream cheese, sugar, egg, and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy.
6. Pour 3/4 of the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly.
7. Spoon dollops of the cheesecake batter over the brownie layer. Use a butter knife to gently swirl the cheesecake mixture into the brownie batter, creating a marbled effect.
8. Pour the remaining brownie batter on top, and continue swirling the two batters together.
9. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few fudgy crumbs. Be careful not to overbake.
10. Allow the cheesecake brownies to cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares and serving.

These cheesecake brownies are a delightful combination of rich chocolate and creamy cheesecake. Enjoy them as a sweet treat with a cup of coffee or serve them as a crowd-pleasing dessert at your next gathering.
