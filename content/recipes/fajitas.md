**Ingredients**
- 1 lb (450g) of flank steak or chicken breast, thinly sliced
- 2 bell peppers, sliced into strips (preferably red and green for colorful presentation)
- 1 large onion, sliced into strips
- 2 tablespoons of oil (vegetable or olive oil)
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon of ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon of chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon of smoked paprika
- Juice of 1 lime
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Warm tortillas
- Optional toppings: sour cream, guacamole, salsa, shredded cheese, chopped cilantro

**Instructions**
1. In a bowl, combine the sliced steak or chicken with the minced garlic, ground cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, lime juice, salt, and pepper. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator for maximum flavor.

2. Heat one tablespoon of oil in a large skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Add the marinated meat and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the cooked meat from the skillet and set it aside.

3. In the same skillet, heat another tablespoon of oil. Add the sliced bell peppers and onion. Sauté until they are tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

4. Return the cooked meat to the skillet with the sautéed peppers and onions. Stir everything together and let it cook for another minute to combine the flavors.

5. Warm the tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave according to the package instructions.

6. Serve the fajita filling alongside warm tortillas, allowing each person to assemble their own fajitas with their preferred toppings such as sour cream, guacamole, salsa, shredded cheese, and chopped cilantro.
