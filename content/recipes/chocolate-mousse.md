**Ingredients**
- 8 ounces of dark chocolate, finely chopped
- 3/4 cup of heavy cream
- 3 large eggs, separated
- 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract
- Optional toppings: whipped cream, chocolate shavings, berries

**Instructions**
1. Melt the chocolate: Place the chopped dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Stir the chocolate occasionally until melted and smooth. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
2. Whip the cream: In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Set aside.
3. Beat the egg yolks and sugar: In another bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together until well combined and creamy.
4. Add the melted chocolate: Gradually pour the melted chocolate into the egg yolk mixture, stirring continuously until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla extract and mix well.
5. Fold in the whipped cream: Gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture until no streaks remain.
6. Beat the egg whites: In a clean bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.
7. Incorporate the egg whites: Carefully fold the beaten egg whites into the chocolate mixture until well combined. Be gentle to maintain the fluffy texture.
8. Chill and serve: Divide the chocolate mousse evenly among serving glasses or bowls. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until set. Before serving, you may choose to top with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, or berries if desired.

Enjoy this delectable chocolate mousse as is or use it as a filling for cakes or pastries. It's a velvety dessert that will surely satisfy your chocolate cravings!
