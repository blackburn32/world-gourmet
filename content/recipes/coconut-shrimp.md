**Ingredients**
- 1 pound of large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 1 cup of all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon of paprika
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup of sweetened shredded coconut
- Vegetable oil, for frying
- Dipping sauce of your choice (e.g., sweet chili sauce, mango salsa)

**Instructions**
1. In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, and paprika.
2. In another bowl, beat the eggs.
3. Dip each shrimp into the flour mixture, then into the beaten eggs, and finally into the shredded coconut, pressing gently to adhere the coconut to the shrimp.
4. Place the coated shrimp on a baking sheet and refrigerate for 15-20 minutes to allow the coconut coating to set.
5. In a deep skillet or frying pan, heat enough vegetable oil to submerge the shrimp to a temperature of 350°F (175°C).
6. Carefully add the shrimp to the hot oil in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for about 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown and crispy.
7. Remove the shrimp from the oil using a slotted spoon and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
8. Serve the coconut shrimp warm with your favorite dipping sauce.
