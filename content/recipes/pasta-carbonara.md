**Ingredients**
- 200g spaghetti
- 100g pancetta
- 2 large eggs
- 50g pecorino cheese
- 50g parmesan
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt

**Instructions**
1. Boil the spaghetti in a pot of salted water until it is al dente.
2. Meanwhile, fry the pancetta in a hot pan until crispy.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and mix in both cheeses.
4. Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it quickly so it's still wet, reserving some of the pasta water.
5. Add the hot spaghetti to the pancetta and mix well to coat in the fat.
6. Remove from the heat and quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture.
7. Stir until the egg cooks slightly and forms a creamy sauce (add some reserved pasta water if necessary).
8. Season with plenty of black pepper and enjoy!
