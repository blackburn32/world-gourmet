**Ingredients:**
- 1 pound of beef (such as sirloin or flank steak), thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup of soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons of mirin (sweet rice wine)
- 2 tablespoons of brown sugar
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon of grated ginger
- 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
- 2 green onions, chopped (for garnish)
- Sesame seeds (for garnish)

**Instructions:**
1. In a bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, mirin, brown sugar, minced garlic, and grated ginger to make the teriyaki sauce.
2. Place the thinly sliced beef in a ziplock bag or a bowl and pour half of the teriyaki sauce over it. Reserve the remaining sauce for later.
3. Marinate the beef in the sauce for at least 30 minutes, or overnight for more flavor.
4. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.
5. Remove the beef from the marinade and shake off any excess sauce.
6. Add the beef to the hot skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, until browned and cooked to your desired doneness.
7. Pour in the remaining teriyaki sauce and let it simmer for a minute, stirring continuously, until the sauce thickens and coats the beef.
8. Remove from heat and garnish with chopped green onions and sesame seeds.
9. Serve the beef teriyaki over steamed rice or noodles, and enjoy!

Note: For a complete meal, you can add stir-fried vegetables like broccoli, bell peppers, or carrots to the beef teriyaki. Simply cook the vegetables in a separate skillet with a little oil until tender-crisp, then mix them with the cooked beef and teriyaki sauce.
