**Ingredients**
- 500g beef, cubed
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 200g mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tablespoons of flour
- 1 cup beef broth
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 sheet of puff pastry
- 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)

**Instructions**
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F).
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown the beef cubes on all sides. Remove the beef from the skillet and set aside.
3. In the same skillet, add the diced onion and minced garlic. Sauté until the onion is translucent.
4. Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook until they release their moisture and start to brown.
5. Sprinkle the flour over the mushrooms and onions, stirring well to combine and coat everything in the flour.
6. Slowly pour in the beef broth while stirring continuously to prevent lumps from forming.
7. Return the beef cubes to the skillet and add Worcestershire sauce, thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine.
8. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for 10 minutes, until the sauce has thickened.
9. Transfer the beef and mushroom mixture to a pie dish.
10. Roll out the puff pastry sheet slightly larger than the size of the pie dish. Place the pastry over the filling, pressing the edges to seal.
11. Make a few small slits on the top of the pastry to allow steam to escape.
12. Brush the top of the pastry with the beaten egg to give it a golden finish.
13. Place the pie dish in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and cooked through.
14. Remove from the oven and let the pie cool for a few minutes before serving.
15. Slice and serve the beef and mushroom pie as a hearty and delicious meal.

Enjoy your Beef and Mushroom Pie!
