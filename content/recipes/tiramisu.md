**Ingredients:**
- 6 egg yolks
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 2/3 cup milk
- 1 1/4 cups heavy cream
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 8 ounces mascarpone cheese
- 1 cup strong brewed coffee, cooled
- 24 ladyfingers
- 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, for dusting

**Instructions:**
1. In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until well combined.
2. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, ensuring that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water.
3. Continuously whisk the egg yolk mixture for about 5 minutes, or until it becomes thick and pale yellow in color.
4. Remove the bowl from heat and whisk in the milk until well incorporated. Set aside to cool.
5. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream and vanilla extract until soft peaks form.
6. Add the mascarpone cheese to the cooled egg yolk mixture and gently fold until combined.
7. Gently fold in the whipped cream until smooth and well incorporated.
8. Dip each ladyfinger into the coffee, ensuring they are soaked but not overly saturated. Arrange a layer of soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9x9-inch dish.
9. Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, ensuring an even layer.
10. Repeat the process with another layer of soaked ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone mixture.
11. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight to allow the flavors to meld together.
12. Before serving, dust the top of the tiramisu with cocoa powder using a fine-mesh sieve.
13. Slice and serve chilled. Enjoy!

Note: Tiramisu can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
