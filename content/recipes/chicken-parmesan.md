**Ingredients**
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup breadcrumbs
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 cups marinara sauce
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- Fresh basil leaves, for garnish

**Instructions**
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Place the flour in a shallow dish. In another dish, whisk the eggs. In a third dish, combine the breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, dried oregano, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper.
3. Butterfly the chicken breasts by cutting them horizontally, leaving one side connected. Open the breasts like a book.
4. Dip each chicken breast into the flour, shaking off any excess. Then dip it into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off. Finally, coat the chicken in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to adhere.
5. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the breaded chicken breasts and cook until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a baking dish.
6. Spoon marinara sauce over each chicken breast, covering them completely. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
8. Remove from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh basil leaves before serving.
9. Serve the Chicken Parmesan hot, alongside pasta or a side salad.
