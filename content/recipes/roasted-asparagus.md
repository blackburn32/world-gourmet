**Ingredients**
- 1 bunch of fresh asparagus spears
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
- Lemon wedges, for serving

**Instructions**
1. Preheat the oven to 425F (220C).
2. Trim the tough ends of the asparagus spears by gently bending them until they naturally snap. Discard the tough ends.
3. Place the asparagus spears on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Toss the asparagus to evenly coat them with the oil.
4. Season the asparagus with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. You can also sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese for extra flavor.
5. Arrange the asparagus spears in a single layer on the baking sheet, making sure they are evenly spaced.
6. Roast the asparagus in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly crispy at the tips. The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the asparagus, so keep an eye on them.
7. Once roasted, remove the asparagus from the oven and squeeze fresh lemon juice over the top. This will enhance the flavors and add a refreshing citrusy touch.
8. Serve the roasted asparagus immediately as a side dish with your favorite main course. It's best enjoyed when it's still warm.

Roasted asparagus is a versatile dish that complements grilled meats, roasted chicken, or even pasta dishes. It adds a touch of elegance to any meal while maintaining its simplicity. Enjoy the wonderful flavors of this delicious vegetable!
