**Ingredients**
- 8 oz cream cheese, softened
- 1/2 cup lump crab meat, drained and flaked
- 2 green onions, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
- 24 wonton wrappers
- Oil for frying

**Instructions**

1. In a bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, crab meat, green onions, minced garlic, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly incorporated.
   
2. Lay out a wonton wrapper on a clean surface. Place approximately 1 tablespoon of the crab filling in the center of the wrapper.

3. Dip your finger in water and moisten the edges of the wonton wrapper.

4. Fold the opposite corners of the wrapper together, forming a triangle. Press the edges firmly to seal the wonton.

5. Fold the two bottom corners of the triangle up toward the tip, overlapping them slightly. Moisten one of the bottom corners with water and press the two corners together to seal.
   
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until all the crab mixture is used.

7. Fill a pot or deep frying pan with oil to a depth of about 2 inches. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (175°C).

8. Carefully drop a few crab rangoons into the hot oil, being cautious not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for about 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and crispy, turning halfway through to ensure even cooking.

9. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried crab rangoons to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat the frying process with the remaining crab rangoons.

10. Serve hot with sweet and sour sauce or a dipping sauce of your choice.
