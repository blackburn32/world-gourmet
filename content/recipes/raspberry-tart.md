**Ingredients**
- 1 ½ cups of all-purpose flour
- ½ cup of unsalted butter, cold and cubed
- ¼ cup of granulated sugar
- Pinch of salt
- 2-3 tablespoons of ice-cold water
- 2 cups of fresh raspberries
- 1 tablespoon of lemon juice
- ¼ cup of granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons of cornstarch
- Powdered sugar, for garnish (optional)
- Fresh mint leaves, for garnish (optional)

**Instructions**
1. In a food processor, pulse together the flour, cold butter, granulated sugar, and salt until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
2. Gradually add in the ice-cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue pulsing until the dough comes together.
3. Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a disk. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
4. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
5. Roll out the chilled dough on a floured surface to fit a tart pan. Gently press the dough into the pan, trimming any excess.
6. In a bowl, combine the raspberries, lemon juice, granulated sugar, and cornstarch. Toss until the raspberries are coated evenly.
7. Pour the raspberry mixture into the prepared tart crust, spreading it out evenly.
8. Bake the tart for 25-30 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the raspberries are bubbling.
9. Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool completely before serving.
10. Optional: Dust the tart with powdered sugar and garnish with fresh mint leaves before serving.

Serve your delicious raspberry tart as is or with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Enjoy the burst of raspberry flavor in every bite!
