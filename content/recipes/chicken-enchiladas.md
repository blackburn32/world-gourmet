**Ingredients**
- 2 cups cooked shredded chicken
- 8-10 flour tortillas
- 1 cup grated cheese (cheddar or Monterey Jack)
- 1/2 cup chopped onion
- 1/2 cup chopped bell peppers
- 1 can (10 oz) enchilada sauce
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional toppings: sour cream, guacamole, chopped cilantro

**Instructions**
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a baking dish with oil or cooking spray.
2. In a skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add onions and bell peppers, and cook until they become soft and translucent.
3. Add shredded chicken to the skillet, season with salt and pepper, and stir well to combine with the vegetables. Cook for a few more minutes until heated through.
4. Warm the tortillas in the microwave or on a skillet to make them pliable.
5. Place a spoonful of the chicken mixture onto each tortilla, roll it tightly, and place it seam-side down into the prepared baking dish. Repeat until all tortillas are filled.
6. Pour the enchilada sauce over the rolled tortillas, ensuring they're all coated evenly.
7. Sprinkle the grated cheese on top of the enchiladas.
8. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
9. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 5 minutes to allow the cheese to lightly brown.
10. Once done, remove from the oven and let the enchiladas rest for a few minutes before serving.
11. Serve the chicken enchiladas hot, garnished with optional toppings such as sour cream, guacamole, and chopped cilantro.
