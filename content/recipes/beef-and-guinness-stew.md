**Ingredients**
- 2 lbs (900g) stewing beef, cut into chunks
- 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 3 carrots, sliced
- 2 celery stalks, sliced
- 1 parsnip, peeled and chopped
- 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour
- 1 can (14.9 oz/440ml) of Guinness beer
- 2 cups of beef broth
- 2 tablespoons of tomato paste
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon of dried thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

**Instructions**
1. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.
2. Season the beef chunks with salt and pepper, then add them to the pot. Brown the beef on all sides until well seared. Remove the beef from the pot and set it aside.
3. In the same pot, add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Saute until the onions become translucent and lightly browned.
4. Add the carrots, celery, and parsnip to the pot. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir well to coat. Cook for an additional 2 minutes to cook off the raw flour taste.
6. Slowly pour in the Guinness beer, stirring constantly to deglaze the pot.
7. Add the beef broth, tomato paste, bay leaves, and dried thyme to the pot. Stir well to combine.
8. Return the seared beef chunks to the pot, along with any accumulated juices. Stir everything together.
9. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for 2-3 hours, or until the beef is tender and the flavors have melded together. Stir occasionally.
10. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.
11. Serve the beef and Guinness stew hot, garnished with fresh chopped parsley. It pairs well with crusty bread or creamy mashed potatoes.
