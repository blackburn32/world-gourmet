Welcome to World Gourmet's feature on a powerful, flavor-evoking pantry staple used worldwide: **Soy Sauce**.

## What is Soy Sauce?

Soy sauce is a condiment derived from fermented soybeans mixed with roasted grain, brine, and a mold called Aspergillus. Soy sauce is widely used in East and Southeast Asian cuisine and is slowly gaining popularity worldwide. It adds a salty, umami kick to food, enhancing it with a burst of rich, complex flavors.

## Types of Soy Sauce

There are two main categories of Soy Sauce:

1. **Light Soy Sauce** - It is a thin, light-brown sauce that imparts a salty flavor, often used in steamed and stir-fried dishes. [See Light Soy Sauce](https://worldgourmet.com/soysauce/lightsoysauce)

2. **Dark Soy Sauce** - This variant is thicker, less salty and boasts a deep, sweet flavor because of the addition of caramel and, occasionally, molasses. It is mostly used in cooking and marinating. [See Dark Soy Sauce](https://worldgourmet.com/soysauce/darksoysauce)

## Benefits of Soy Sauce

Beyond being a potent flavor enhancer, Soy Sauce offers a range of health benefits:

1. **High in Antioxidants**
2. **Provides important minerals** like Selenium and Copper
