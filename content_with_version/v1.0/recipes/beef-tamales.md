**Ingredients:**
- 2 cups of masa harina (corn flour)
- 1 ½ cups of beef broth
- 1 cup of shredded cooked beef
- ½ cup of vegetable shortening
- 1 teaspoon of baking powder
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1 teaspoon of chili powder
- 1 teaspoon of cumin powder
- ½ teaspoon of garlic powder
- Corn husks, soaked in warm water

**Instructions:**
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the masa harina, baking powder, salt, chili powder, cumin powder, and garlic powder. Mix well.
2. In a separate bowl, mix the beef broth and vegetable shortening until the shortening melts and combines with the broth.
3. Gradually pour the broth mixture into the dry ingredients while stirring with a spoon or your hands. Mix until a slightly sticky dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add more broth; if it's too wet, add more masa harina.
4. In a skillet, heat the cooked shredded beef and season it with additional spices if desired.
5. Take a soaked corn husk and spread a thin layer of masa dough onto the smooth side of the husk, leaving a border around the edges.
6. Place a spoonful of the seasoned beef filling in the center of the masa dough.
7. Roll the corn husk tightly, folding the sides towards the center to enclose the filling. Tie the ends with strips of soaked corn husks or kitchen twine to secure the tamale.
8. Repeat the process with the remaining corn husks and dough until all the filling is used.
9. Place a steamer basket or a large pot with a steamer insert on the stove. Fill it with water, making sure it doesn't touch the steamer rack or insert.
10. Arrange the tamales vertically in the steamer, open side up. If you don't have enough tamales to fill the entire steamer, use crumpled foil to fill the empty spaces.
11. Cover the tamales with a damp cloth or more corn husks to prevent steam from escaping and bring the water to a boil.
12. Reduce the heat to medium-low and steam the tamales for about 1.5 to 2 hours until the dough is firm and easily separates from the husk.
13. Allow the tamales to cool for a few minutes before unwrapping and serving.

Serve the beef tamales with your favorite salsa or sauce and enjoy this delicious and authentic Mexican dish.
