**Ingredients**

For the chicken:
- 1 whole chicken, cut into pieces
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 4 cups of chicken broth
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil

For the dumplings:
- 2 cups of all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon of baking powder
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1 cup of milk
- 3 tablespoons of melted butter

**Instructions**

1. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside.

2. In the same pot, add the chopped onion, carrots, celery, and garlic. Sauté until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.

3. Return the chicken to the pot and pour in the chicken broth. Season with salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 1 hour, until the chicken is cooked through and tender.

4. While the chicken is simmering, prepare the dumplings. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the milk and melted butter until a soft dough forms.

5. Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pot and shred the meat using two forks. Discard the bones and return the shredded chicken to the pot.

6. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the broth mixture to a gentle boil. Drop spoonfuls of the dumpling dough into the boiling broth, spacing them apart.

7. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the dumplings are cooked through and fluffy.

8. Serve the chicken and dumplings hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley if desired.
