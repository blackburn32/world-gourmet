**Ingredients:**
- 4-5 pounds of pork shoulder or pork butt
- 2 tablespoons of brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons of paprika
- 1 tablespoon of garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon of onion powder
- 1 tablespoon of salt
- 1 teaspoon of black pepper
- 1 cup of barbecue sauce
- 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 cup of chicken broth
- 8-10 hamburger buns
- Coleslaw (optional, for serving)

**Instructions:**
1. In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper to make a dry rub.
2. Rub the dry rub all over the pork shoulder, making sure to coat it well. Let the pork sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes to absorb the flavors.
3. Preheat your smoker or grill to around 225-250°F (107-121°C) for indirect cooking.
4. Place the pork shoulder on the smoker or grill, and cook it low and slow for about 8-10 hours, or until the internal temperature of the meat reaches around 195°F (90°C) and the meat is tender and easily pulls apart.
5. While the pork is smoking, mix together the barbecue sauce, apple cider vinegar, and chicken broth in a saucepan over low heat. Simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes to let the flavors meld together.
6. Once the pork is cooked, remove it from the smoker or grill and let it rest for about 15 minutes.
7. Using two forks or meat claws, shred the pork into small pieces.
8. Pour the BBQ sauce mixture over the shredded pork and mix it well to coat the meat evenly. You can add more sauce according to your preference.
9. Toast the hamburger buns lightly, then fill each bun with a generous amount of pulled pork.
10. Serve the pulled pork sandwiches with coleslaw on top, if desired. The cool, crunchy coleslaw complements the smoky and savory flavors of the pork perfectly.

Enjoy your delicious homemade pulled pork sandwiches! They make for a fantastic meal, whether you're hosting a barbecue party or simply enjoying a flavorful lunch or dinner.
