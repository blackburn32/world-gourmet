**Ingredients**
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
- 1/4 cup capers, drained
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped

**Instructions**
1. Start by pounding the chicken breasts to an even thickness of about 1/2 inch. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
2. Place the flour on a plate and dredge each chicken breast in it, shaking off the excess.
3. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook for about 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
4. In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chicken broth, lemon juice, and capers. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the sauce slightly thickens.
5. Return the chicken breasts to the skillet and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, basting them with the sauce.
6. Serve the chicken piccata over cooked pasta or rice, spooning the sauce over the top. Garnish with fresh parsley.
