**Ingredients**
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 8 ounces mushrooms, sliced
- 1/2 cup Marsala wine
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

**Instructions**
1. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.
2. Place the flour in a shallow dish and dredge the chicken breasts in the flour, shaking off any excess.
3. Heat the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
4. Add the chicken breasts to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
5. In the same skillet, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and start to brown.
6. Pour in the Marsala wine and chicken broth, scraping the bottom of the skillet to deglaze and incorporate any browned bits.
7. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, or until slightly reduced.
8. Return the chicken breasts to the skillet and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until heated through.
9. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve with your choice of pasta, rice, or mashed potatoes.

Enjoy your delicious Chicken Marsala!
