**Ingredients**
- 2 pounds of pork shoulder, thinly sliced
- 1 medium-sized pineapple, peeled and sliced
- 1/2 cup of orange juice
- 1/4 cup of white vinegar
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, chopped
- 1 tablespoon of achiote paste
- 1 teaspoon of dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon of cumin
- 1 teaspoon of paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- Corn tortillas
- Toppings: chopped onions, cilantro, pineapple chunks, lime wedges

**Instructions**
1. In a blender, combine the orange juice, white vinegar, minced garlic, chopped chipotle peppers, achiote paste, dried oregano, cumin, paprika, and salt. Blend until smooth to create the marinade.
2. Place the thinly sliced pork shoulder in a large resealable bag or a container. Pour the marinade over the pork, making sure it's well-coated. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight for the best flavor.
3. Preheat your grill or oven to medium-high heat. If using a grill, heat it up to about 400°F (200°C). If using an oven, preheat it to the same temperature.
4. Drain the marinade from the pork, reserving it for basting. Thread the marinated pork and pineapple slices onto skewers, alternating between the two.
5. Grill or roast the skewers for about 15-20 minutes, turning and basting with the reserved marinade occasionally, until the meat is cooked through and slightly charred.
6. Once cooked, remove the pork and pineapple from the skewers and chop into small pieces.
7. Warm the corn tortillas on a griddle or in the oven.
8. Assemble the tacos by placing the chopped pork and pineapple onto the warm tortillas. Top with chopped onions, cilantro, pineapple chunks, and a squeeze of lime juice.
9. Serve immediately and enjoy the delicious Tacos al Pastor!

Note: Feel free to adjust the spice levels by reducing or increasing the amount of chipotle peppers in the marinade. You can also add your favorite salsa or hot sauce for an extra kick.
