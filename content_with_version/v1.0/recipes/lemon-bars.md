**Ingredients**
- For the crust:
  - 1 cup of all-purpose flour
  - 1/4 cup of powdered sugar
  - 1/2 cup of cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes

- For the lemon filling:
  - 1 1/2 cups of granulated sugar
  - 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour
  - 4 large eggs
  - Zest of 2 lemons
  - 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice
  - Powdered sugar, for dusting

**Instructions**
1. Preheat the oven to 350�F (175�C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish and line it with parchment paper.

2. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and powdered sugar for the crust. Add the cold butter cubes and using a pastry cutter or your fingers, mix until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

3. Press the crust mixture evenly into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until lightly golden.

4. In another mixing bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar and flour for the lemon filling. Add the eggs, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Whisk until well combined and smooth.

5. Pour the lemon filling over the baked crust, spreading it out evenly. Return the baking dish to the oven and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the filling is set.

6. Remove the lemon bars from the oven and let them cool completely in the baking dish. Once cooled, refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight to allow them to set.

7. Once chilled, remove the lemon bars from the baking dish using the parchment paper as handles. Cut into squares or bars. Dust with powdered sugar before serving.
