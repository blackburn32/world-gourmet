**Ingredients:**
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon grated ginger
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons water
- Sesame seeds, for garnish (optional)
- Sliced green onions, for garnish (optional)

**Instructions:**
1. In a bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, mirin, honey, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger to make the teriyaki sauce.
2. Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish or a plastic bag and pour half of the teriyaki sauce over the chicken. Reserve the remaining sauce for later.
3. Marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, but ideally for 2 hours to allow the flavors to develop.
4. Preheat your grill or skillet to medium-high heat. If using a skillet, add a bit of cooking oil to prevent sticking.
5. Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade.
6. Cook the chicken for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) and is nicely browned.
7. While the chicken is cooking, prepare the teriyaki glaze. In a small saucepan, combine the remaining teriyaki sauce, cornstarch, and water. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens.
8. Brush the cooked chicken with the teriyaki glaze, turning the chicken to coat evenly. Allow it to cook for an additional minute or so to let the glaze caramelize slightly.
9. Remove the chicken from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes.
10. Serve the teriyaki chicken over steamed rice and garnish with sesame seeds and sliced green onions, if desired.
11. Enjoy your homemade Teriyaki Chicken!
