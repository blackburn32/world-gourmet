**Ingredients**
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 lemons
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon of dried thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Chopped fresh parsley for garnish

**Instructions**
1. Start by juicing one of the lemons and zesting both lemons. Set aside the juice and zest separately.
2. In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic, lemon juice, lemon zest, dried thyme, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
3. Place the chicken breasts in the marinade, ensuring they are evenly coated. Let them marinate for at least 20 minutes in the refrigerator.
4. Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium heat.
5. Cook the marinated chicken breasts for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until they reach an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C). Cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of your chicken breasts.
6. Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes.
7. Serve the lemon chicken hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley.
8. Optionally, squeeze some fresh lemon juice over the chicken before serving for an extra burst of citrus flavor.

Enjoy your delicious and refreshing lemon chicken!
