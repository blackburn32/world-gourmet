**Ingredients**
- 1 lb (450g) of fresh asparagus, woody ends trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter
- 3 cups of vegetable broth
- 1 cup of heavy cream
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh herbs (such as chives or parsley) for garnish

**Instructions**
1. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until they become soft and fragrant.
2. Add the asparagus pieces to the pot and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Pour in the vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the asparagus is tender.
4. Once the asparagus is cooked, remove the pot from heat and allow the mixture to cool slightly.
5. Using an immersion blender or a regular blender, puree the soup until smooth and creamy. Be careful when blending hot liquids - leave a vent for steam to escape if using a regular blender.
6. Return the soup to the pot and place it back on low heat. Stir in the heavy cream and season with salt and pepper to taste. Heat the soup for an additional 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. Serve the hot asparagus soup in bowls, garnished with fresh herbs like chives or parsley.

Enjoy the delightful flavors of this creamy asparagus soup! Pair it with a slice of crusty bread for a satisfying meal.
