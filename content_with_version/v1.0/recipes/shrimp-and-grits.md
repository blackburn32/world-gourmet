- 1 cup of cheddar cheese, grated
- 1 pound of shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 4 slices of bacon, chopped
- 1 small onion, diced
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon of butter
- 1 tablespoon of Cajun seasoning

**Instructions**
1. In a medium-sized saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Slowly whisk in the grits and reduce the heat to low. Cook the grits, stirring occasionally, for about 20-30 minutes until they are creamy and tender.
2. Stir in the grated cheddar cheese until melted and well incorporated. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep the grits warm while preparing the shrimp.

4. In the same skillet, add the diced onion and minced garlic. Sauté them until the onion becomes translucent and fragrant.
5. Add the shrimp to the skillet along with the Cajun seasoning. Cook the shrimp for about 2-3 minutes per side until they turn pink and opaque.
6. Once the shrimp are cooked, stir in the butter until melted and evenly distributed.
7. To serve, divide the cheesy grits among serving bowls or plates. Top each serving with a portion of the shrimp and garnish with the crispy bacon and fresh parsley.
