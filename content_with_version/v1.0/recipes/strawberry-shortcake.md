**Ingredients**
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold and cubed
- 2/3 cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups fresh strawberries, sliced
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar (for strawberries)
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons powdered sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

**Instructions**
1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease and flour a round cake pan.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt.
3. Add the cold cubed butter to the dry ingredients. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.
4. Pour in the milk and vanilla extract. Stir until just combined and a sticky dough forms.
5. Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead it gently for a minute or two. Do not over-knead.
6. Press the dough into the greased and floured cake pan, spreading it out evenly.
7. Bake for 18-22 minutes or until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
8. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.
9. In a bowl, combine the sliced strawberries and 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar. Toss them together gently and let them sit for 10-15 minutes to release their juices.
10. In a separate bowl, beat the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.
11. Once the cake has cooled, carefully slice it in half horizontally.
12. Place the bottom half of the cake on a serving plate. Spoon half of the strawberry mixture onto the cake and spread it out evenly.
13. Next, spread half of the whipped cream over the strawberries.
14. Place the top half of the cake over the whipped cream layer.
15. Repeat the process by spreading the remaining strawberries and whipped cream over the top of the cake.
16. Optionally, garnish with additional fresh strawberries.
17. Slice and serve immediately. Enjoy your homemade strawberry shortcake!

Now you have a delightful and refreshing dessert to enjoy with family and friends. Happy baking!
