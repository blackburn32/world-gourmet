- 1 zucchini, thinly sliced
- 1 yellow squash, thinly sliced
- 1 bell pepper, thinly sliced

- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 cup ricotta cheese
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

**Instructions**
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions, then set aside.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, and sauté for about 3 minutes until fragrant.
3. Add zucchini, yellow squash, bell pepper, and mushrooms to the skillet. Cook for about 5 minutes until the vegetables are tender.
4. Stir in the diced tomatoes, marinara sauce, dried basil, and dried oregano. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Allow the mixture to simmer for 10 minutes.
5. In a separate bowl, combine the shredded mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, and grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well.
6. To assemble the lasagna, spread a layer of the vegetable mixture in the bottom of a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Top with a layer of lasagna noodles, followed by a layer of the cheese mixture. Repeat until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of cheese on top.
7. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes until the cheese on top is golden and bubbly.
8. Let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.
