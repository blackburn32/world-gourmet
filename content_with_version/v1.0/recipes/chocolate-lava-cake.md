**Ingredients:**
- 1/2 cup of unsalted butter
- 4 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate
- 1 cup of powdered sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 large egg yolks
- 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour
- Pinch of salt
- Optional: powdered sugar or whipped cream for garnish

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Grease and lightly flour four ramekins or custard cups.
2. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter and semi-sweet chocolate together, stirring until smooth. You can also melt them in a double boiler over simmering water.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla extract until well combined.
4. Slowly pour the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly until smooth.
5. Add the flour and salt to the chocolate mixture, and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
6. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared ramekins or custard cups, filling each about 3/4 of the way.
7. Place the ramekins or custard cups on a baking sheet and bake for about 12-14 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still slightly soft.
8. Remove from the oven and let the cakes cool in the ramekins or custard cups for about 5 minutes.
9. Carefully invert each ramekin or custard cup onto a serving plate. Tap the bottom of the ramekin or custard cup to release the cake. Lift the ramekin or custard cup away, and the cake should slide out with a gooey, chocolate lava center.
10. Optional: Dust with powdered sugar or serve with a dollop of whipped cream. Serve the chocolate lava cakes immediately.
