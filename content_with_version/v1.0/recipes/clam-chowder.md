**Ingredients**
- 2 pounds of fresh clams
- 4 slices of bacon, diced
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2 large potatoes, peeled and diced
- 2 cups of vegetable broth
- 1 cup of heavy cream
- 1 bay leaf
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Chopped parsley for garnish

**Instructions**
1. Scrub the clams thoroughly and discard any that are cracked or open.
2. In a large pot, cook the diced bacon until crispy. Remove the bacon and set it aside, leaving the bacon fat in the pot.
3. Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the pot and sauté until the onion is translucent.
4. Add the diced potatoes, vegetable broth, and bay leaf to the pot. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the potatoes are tender, about 10-15 minutes.
5. While the potatoes are cooking, in a separate pot, steam the clams over high heat until they open. Remove the clams from the pot and discard any that did not open. Remove the clams from their shells and set aside.
6. Once the potatoes are tender, remove the bay leaf from the pot and use an immersion blender to partially blend the soup, leaving some chunks of potato.
7. Add the steamed clams, reserved bacon, and heavy cream to the pot. Stir well and season with salt and pepper to taste.
8. Simmer the soup for an additional 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
9. Serve the clam chowder hot, garnished with chopped parsley.

Enjoy your delicious homemade Clam Chowder!
