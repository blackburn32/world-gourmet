**Ingredients**
- 8 ounces of pancetta, diced
- 1 lb of spaghetti or linguine
- 4 large eggs, beaten
- 1 cup of grated Parmesan cheese
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup of fresh parsley, chopped
- Salt and black pepper to taste

**Instructions**
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
2. In a separate skillet, cook the diced pancetta over medium heat until crispy and browned. Remove from the heat and set aside.
3. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the beaten eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, minced garlic, and chopped parsley. Season with salt and black pepper.
4. Return the drained pasta to the pot and place it over low heat. Pour the egg mixture over the pasta and toss quickly to coat the strands. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce.
5. Add the cooked pancetta to the pasta and toss again to distribute the ingredients evenly.
6. Serve immediately, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese and parsley if desired.

Enjoy this indulgent Pancetta Carbonara as a comforting and flavorful meal. Buon appetito!
