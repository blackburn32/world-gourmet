**Ingredients:**
- 4 large onions, thinly sliced
- 4 tablespoons of butter
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 4 cups of beef broth
- 2 cups of water
- 1/2 cup of dry white wine (optional)
- 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon of thyme leaves
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Baguette slices
- Gruyere or Swiss cheese, shredded

**Instructions:**
1. In a large pot, melt the butter and olive oil over medium heat.
2. Add the thinly sliced onions to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are caramelized and golden brown. This process may take about 30-40 minutes.
3. Add the minced garlic to the pot and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.
4. Pour in the beef broth, water, and white wine (if using) into the pot. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce, thyme leaves, salt, and pepper.
5. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for about 20-30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
6. While the soup is simmering, preheat your broiler and toast the baguette slices until they are lightly golden.
7. Ladle the soup into individual oven-safe bowls or crocks.
8. Place a toasted baguette slice on top of each bowl of soup and sprinkle a generous amount of shredded Gruyere or Swiss cheese on top.
9. Place the bowls under the broiler until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 2-3 minutes.
10. Carefully remove the bowls from the broiler (they will be hot!) and let them cool for a few minutes before serving.
