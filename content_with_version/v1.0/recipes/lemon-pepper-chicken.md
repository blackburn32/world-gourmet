**Ingredients:**
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 2 lemons
- 1 tablespoon of freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon of dried oregano

**Instructions:**
1. Begin by preheating your oven to 425°F (220°C).
2. Place the chicken breasts on a cutting board and pat them dry with a paper towel.
3. In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, juice of one lemon, minced garlic, black pepper, salt, and dried oregano. Mix well to create a marinade.
4. Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish or a zip-top bag, and pour the marinade over them, making sure to coat each piece evenly. Let the chicken marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes (you can also marinate it overnight for more flavor).
5. Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat and add a bit of olive oil. Once the skillet is hot, carefully place the chicken breasts in it, allowing any excess marinade to drip off.
6. Sear the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side until they develop a golden brown color.
7. Cut the remaining lemon into thin slices.
8. Place the lemon slices on top of the chicken breasts in the skillet.
9. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for about 15-20 minutes or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C) and is no longer pink in the center.
10. Remove from the oven and allow the chicken to rest for a few minutes before serving.
11. Serve the lemon pepper chicken with your favorite side dishes, such as roasted vegetables, steamed rice, or a fresh salad.

Enjoy the tangy and flavorful lemon pepper chicken! It's a versatile dish that can be enjoyed for a family dinner or dressed up for a special occasion.
