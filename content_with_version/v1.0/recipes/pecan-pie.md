# Pecan Pie
Pecan pie is a classic Southern dessert made with a buttery crust and a sweet, nutty filling. It's the perfect combination of rich, sticky, and crunchy. Here's how to make your own delicious pecan pie.

**Ingredients**
- 1 pre-made pie crust
- 1 1/2 cups of pecan halves
- 3/4 cup of light corn syrup
- 3/4 cup of granulated sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 1/4 cup of melted butter
- 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon of salt

**Instructions**
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Roll out the pre-made pie crust and press it into a 9-inch pie dish.
3. Arrange the pecan halves evenly over the bottom of the pie crust.
4. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the corn syrup, sugar, melted butter, vanilla extract, eggs, and salt. Mix well until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined.
5. Pour the mixture over the pecans in the pie crust, making sure it covers all the pecans.
6. Gently tap the pie dish on the counter to remove any air bubbles.
7. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 50-60 minutes, or until the filling is set and the top is golden brown. You can test the doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of the pie – if it comes out clean, the pie is done.
8. Once the pie is fully baked, remove it from the oven and let it cool completely before serving.
9. Serve the pecan pie at room temperature, optionally topped with whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
10. Enjoy your homemade pecan pie!

Note: If you prefer a deeper flavor, you can also lightly toast the pecans before arranging them in the pie crust. Simply place them on a baking sheet and bake for about 8-10 minutes at 350°F (175°C), then let them cool before using.
