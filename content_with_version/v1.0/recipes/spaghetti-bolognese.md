**Ingredients**
- 1 pound (450g) of ground beef
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 carrot, finely chopped
- 1 celery stalk, finely chopped
- 1 can (14 ounces) of diced tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons of tomato paste
- 1 cup of beef or vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon of dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon of dried basil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Olive oil for cooking
- 1 pound (450g) of spaghetti noodles
- Grated Parmesan cheese for serving
- Fresh basil leaves for garnish

**Instructions**
1. Heat a large skillet or saucepan over medium-high heat, then add a drizzle of olive oil.
2. Add the onion, garlic, carrot, and celery to the pan and sauté until they start to soften, about 5 minutes.
3. Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and add the ground beef. Cook until browned and cooked through, breaking it up with a spatula as it cooks.
4. Once the meat is cooked, add the diced tomatoes (including their juice), tomato paste, beef or vegetable broth, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Stir everything together.
5. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the sauce for at least 30 minutes, or up to 1 hour for a richer flavor. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
6. While the sauce simmers, cook the spaghetti noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta once cooked.
7. Serve the spaghetti with the Bolognese sauce, grated Parmesan cheese, and fresh basil leaves for garnish.
8. Enjoy your homemade Spaghetti Bolognese!

Note: You can also add a splash of red wine or a pinch of red pepper flakes to the sauce for some extra depth of flavor if desired.
