**Ingredients**
- 1 bunch of fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 5 cups of vegetable or chicken broth
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 1/2 cups of Arborio rice
- 1/2 cup of dry white wine
- 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

**Instructions**
1. In a medium-sized saucepan, bring the vegetable or chicken broth to a simmer. Keep it warm over low heat.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large, deep skillet or saucepan over medium heat.
3. Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet and sauté until they become soft and translucent.
4. Add the Arborio rice to the skillet and stir it for a few minutes until the grains are well coated with oil.
5. Pour in the white wine and cook, stirring constantly until it has been absorbed by the rice.
6. Begin adding the warm broth to the skillet, one ladleful at a time, stirring continuously until the liquid is absorbed by the rice before adding the next ladleful. Continue this process for about 15-20 minutes or until the rice is cooked al dente.
7. During the last few minutes of cooking the rice, add the asparagus pieces to the skillet. Cook them until they are tender but still vibrant green.
8. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the grated Parmesan cheese and butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
9. Allow the risotto to rest for a minute before serving.
10. Serve the asparagus risotto in bowls, garnished with freshly chopped parsley.
